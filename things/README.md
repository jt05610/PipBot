# 3D printable things to build PipBot

This directory contains all parts necessary to build PipBot.

## Baseplate

### Files

Print one `baseplate_composite_v1.0.3mf`, **or** print each of the following files:

* `baseplate_split_v1.0_body1.3mf`
* `baseplate_split_v1.0_body2.3mf`
* `baseplate_split_v1.0_body3.3mf`
* `baseplate_split_v1.0_body4.3mf`

### Print settings

* We printed this using PLA with 20% infill, 0.2mm layer height, and with supports.

### Assembly and installation

* Each piece fits together using the dovetail pieces. Remove the glass build plate from the Ender 3V2 and replace it
  with this baseplate. Retain the metal clips and use them to secure the baseplate to the printer. If you need a more
  snug fit, you can add double-sided mounting tape to the bottom of the baseplate.
